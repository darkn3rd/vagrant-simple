# **Multi-Machine Vagrant From Hosts Configuration**

This Vagrant reads custom space separated configuration files, and dynamically builds a set of guest machines based on that configuration.  It also builds `hosts` and `ssh_config` in each system so that they can easily communicate to one another.

# **Instructions**

```bash
vagrant up
```
