# **Multi-Machine Vagrant from JSON**

This is a multi-machine Vagrant system that dynamically configures four systems from a JSON file.

## **Notes**

Provisioning scripts will make changes to `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` for easy access between systems.  After entering one system, e.g. `vagrant ssh client`, you can easily get to another system using just the host name, e.g. `ssh master`.

# **Instructions**

```bash
vagrant up          # start and provision all systems
vagrant ssh         # ssh into master
vagrant ssh client  # ssh into client
vagrant halt client # shutdown client
vagrant halt        # shutdown reaming systems
```
